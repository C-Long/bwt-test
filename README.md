# BwtTest

The task is to implement the encode and decode methods of the Burrows Wheeler Tranform for strings in Ruby as described by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WRANhDiSHM). It isn't necessary to understand the ideas of entropy or why the algorithm works. The goal is modify the gem so that the tests pass. Feel free to add additional private methods to break the problem down into smaller steps. Once the tests are passing, zip (or gzip) your code and email it to jim@motiveflow.com.
